# Beef Supply Chain Cybersecurity Simulation

This project simulates a multi-layered cybersecurity framework designed to protect the beef production and supply chain against cyber threats.  
The simulation models key supply chain nodes, cyberattacks, AI-based anomaly detection, blockchain-like traceability, and incident response protocols.

## Features
- Simulates beef supply chain nodes (farm, feedlot, processing, distribution, retail)
- Generates normal and anomalous IoT telemetry data
- Injects cyberattack scenarios and simulates their impact
- Implements simple anomaly detection for early threat identification
- Simulates blockchain-inspired immutable logging of supply chain data
- Models incident response actions to contain and mitigate attacks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: `simpy`, `networkx`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install simpy networkx
